# DO NOT USE, major bug found in the version of sss that was used. 



# sss-rs-client
A basic client to demonstrate the sss-rs library. Use at your own risk.

One way to implement a client using the sss-rs library, still a WIP.


For usage/help, run:

	- cargo run -- -h

	- cargo run -- create -h

	- cargo run -- reconstruct -h

	or

	- ./target/debug/sss_client -h

	- and so on..
