# sss-rs-client
A basic client to demonstrate the sss-rs library. Use at your own risk.

One way to implement a client using the sss-rs library, still a WIP.

The library is not yet up on crates.io, so in order to compile this code, you must also have
https://github.com/bilowik/sss-rs in the same directory. This will change once the library makes it
to crates.io.

For usage/help, run:
	- cargo run -- -h
	- cargo run -- create -h
	- cargo run -- reconstruct -h
	or
	- ./target/debug/sss_client -h
	- and so on..
